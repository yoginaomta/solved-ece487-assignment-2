 <li>In the following figure, four PCs (with indices 1, 2, 3, and 4) are connected through two bustopology local area networks (LANs). The address configuration is also shown in the figure, where a capital-case letter means an IP address and a number means a physical address. Any data frame in the network has the following format:</li>

</ol>

Assume a process with port address ‘a’ on PC 2 sends a message to a process with port address ‘b’ on PC 3. In the following table, please indicate the source &amp; destination addresses used in the header of Layers 2, 3, and 4, for the data frame from PC 2 to the router and the data frame from the router to PC 3.
